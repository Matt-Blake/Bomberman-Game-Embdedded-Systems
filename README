Welcome to Bomberman!

CONTROLS:

   (_)    Press down on the button to drop a bomb on the tile your player is 
          currently standing on. (Careful as it will detonate in one second!)


GAMEPLAY:

Being a bomberman you have the ability to drop bombs at will! Each of
which will explode after one second, destroying everything in a 'cross' pattern
as such:
            ●
          ● ● ●
            ●

The objective of the game is to kill the enemy bomberman by trapping/cornering
them so that the explosion radius of your bomb overlaps their position. The map
contains a grid-pattern with destructable walls which (you guessed it!) are
destroyed through the use of your bombs! Created by Matt Blake and James Hay.
